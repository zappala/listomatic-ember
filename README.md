# list-o-matic Ember front-end

A simple list application to demonstrate web development
concepts. This version uses Ember for the front end.

Currently, the only supported back end is the [List-o-matic Flask Server](https://github.com/zappala/listomatic-flask-server).

## Installation

First, setup the Flask server. Then, copy the static directory to the
top level directory for the Flask server. Run the flask server and
visit /static/index.html.
